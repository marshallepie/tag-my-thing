# Referral System Update - All Users Can Refer

## Overview
As of January 10, 2025, TagMyThing has updated its referral system to allow all users to create and share referral codes, not just influencers.

## Key Changes

### 1. Universal Referral Access
- **All Users**: Every authenticated user can now generate and share referral codes
- **No Role Restrictions**: Removed the requirement to be an "influencer" to access referrals
- **Automatic Code Generation**: All existing users without referral codes will automatically get one

### 2. Referral Link Destination
- **All referral links now point to**: `/influencer-signup?ref={code}`
- **Reasoning**: Encourages referred users to sign up as influencers for better rewards
- **Fallback**: Users can still choose standard signup from the influencer page

### 3. Token Rewards Structure (Unchanged)
The 5-level referral structure remains exactly as specified:
- **Level 1**: 50 tokens
- **Level 2**: 30 tokens  
- **Level 3**: 20 tokens
- **Level 4**: 10 tokens
- **Level 5**: 5 tokens

### 4. Reward Triggers
- **Tokens awarded**: Only when referred users sign up (not on purchases)
- **No purchase bonuses**: Removed any logic that awarded tokens for referred user purchases
- **Signup only**: Clean, simple reward system based on successful referrals

## Database Changes

- **Access control**: Removed influencer-only restrictions

### 3. Component Updates

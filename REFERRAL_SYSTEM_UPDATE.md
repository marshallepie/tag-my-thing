# Referral System Update - All Users Can Refer

## Overview
As of January 10, 2025, TagMyThing has updated its referral system to allow all users to create and share referral codes, not just influencers. Additionally, users can now choose from multiple landing page destinations for their referral links.

**Important Note**: While all users can generate and share referral codes after signup, their initial signup path (regular via `/auth`, influencer via `/influencer-signup`, or business via `/business-auth`) determines their base user type, initial token bonus, and available features.

## Key Changes

### 1. Universal Referral Access
- **All Users**: Every authenticated user can now generate and share referral codes
- **No Role Restrictions**: Removed the requirement to be an "influencer" to access referrals
- **Automatic Code Generation**: All existing users without referral codes will automatically get one

### 2. Multiple Landing Page Options
- **Landing Page Selection**: Users can now choose from 5 different landing page destinations for their referral links
- **Available Options**:
  - Influencer Signup (Recommended) - `/influencer-signup?ref={code}`
  - General Ownership Tagging - `/general-tagging?ref={code}`
  - Digital Assets & NFT Tagging - `/nft-tagging?ref={code}`
  - MyWill & Legacy Tagging - `/mywill-tagging?ref={code}`
  - Business & Inventory Tagging - `/business-tagging?ref={code}` (leads to `/business-auth`)
- **Default**: Influencer signup remains the recommended option for best rewards

### 3. Token Rewards Structure (Unchanged)
The 5-level referral structure remains exactly as specified:
- **Level 1**: 50 tokens
- **Level 2**: 30 tokens  
- **Level 3**: 20 tokens
- **Level 4**: 10 tokens
- **Level 5**: 5 tokens

### 4. Reward Triggers
- **Tokens awarded**: Only when referred users sign up (not on purchases)
- **No purchase bonuses**: Removed any logic that awarded tokens for referred user purchases
- **Signup only**: Clean, simple reward system based on successful referrals

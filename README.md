# TagMyThing TMT

**TagMyThing** is a digital asset tagging system that lets users document ownership of any item‚Äîphysical or digital‚Äîin a secure, timestamped, and verifiable way.

Whether it's a bike, a car, a hidden bank account, a love letter, or a life story, TagMyThing allows you to:
- Record a video or photo of the asset
- Tag it with metadata (title, description, location, timestamp)
- Store it immutably and securely
- Retrieve it anytime, even years later
- Prove ownership, intention, or message delivery

This is not just a place to leave your *last* will‚Äîit's a place to record your *first* will. Tag your things. Say what they mean to you. Decide what should happen to them. Forever.

## üì± Core Functionality

### Asset Tagging Workflow
1. **Capture** - Use device camera to take photo/video
2. **Tag** - Add title, description, tags, and metadata
3. **Secure** - Store with optional blockchain publishing
4. **Manage** - View, edit, and organize your assets
5. **Share** - Control privacy and next-of-kin access

### Next-of-Kin & Dead Man's Switch
TagMyThing features an advanced Next-of-Kin (NOK) management system with Dead Man's Switch (DMS) protection:

#### Core Features
- **Incoming NOK Assignments** - Track assets where you've been designated as someone's next-of-kin
- **Outgoing NOK Assignments** - Manage assets you've assigned to others as next-of-kin
- **Dead Man's Switch Protection** - Assets are only accessible to NOK after a specified period of inactivity
- **Privacy Protection** - NOK can see they've been assigned without viewing asset details until DMS triggers
- **Mass Assignment** - Assign all your assets to a single NOK in one action
- **Reassignment** - NOK can reassign incoming assignments to other trusted individuals

#### How It Works
1. **Add Next-of-Kin** - Register trusted individuals with their contact information
2. **Assign Assets** - Choose specific assets or use mass assignment to assign all assets
3. **Set DMS Period** - Define how long you must be inactive before access is granted (1-5 years)
4. **Privacy Protection** - NOK only sees assignment notification, not asset details
5. **Automatic Trigger** - If you don't log in within the DMS period, NOK gains access
6. **Reassignment Option** - NOK can reassign responsibility to someone else if needed

#### Dashboard Overview
- **Incoming Count** - Number of assets assigned to you as NOK
- **Outgoing Count** - Number of assets you've assigned to others
- **Triggered Assignments** - Assets where DMS has been activated
- **Upcoming DMS** - Assignments approaching their DMS date

### Token Economy

- **100 TMT** - Free signup bonus for everyone.
- **25 TMT** - Cost per photo tag
- **60 TMT** - Cost per video tag
- **Additional tokens** - Available for purchase on pay as you go.

### User Roles
- Any user can be nominated as NOK.
- Any user can nominate a next of kin.
- Any user can nominate multiple next of kins. (outgoing Noks)
- Any user can be nominated as next of kin by different users. (incomming NOKs)
- **NOK** - Next-of-kin with limited asset access set by visibility switch and by Dead Mans Switch.
- **Moderator** - Content moderation capabilities
- **Admin** - Full platform administration
- **Influencer** - Enhanced referral capabilities, higher signup bonus (100 TMT)
- **Business User** - Access to product verification, QR code generation, and scan history tracking

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The application uses a comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with the following main tables:

- `user_profiles` - Extended user information

- `assets` - Tagged assets with metadata
- `next_of_kin` - Next-of-kin relationships and contact information

- `token_transactions` - Token earning/spending history
- `payments` - Token purchase records
- `referrals` - Referral tracking system

#### Enhanced NOK Schema
The NOK system includes advanced fields for Dead Man's Switch functionality:
- `dms_date` - Date when DMS triggers if user remains inactive
- `status` - Assignment status (pending, active, triggered, cancelled)
- `access_granted_at` - Timestamp when DMS was triggered
- `original_assigner_user_id` - User who created the assignment
- `reassigned_by_user_id` - User who reassigned the NOK responsibility

All tables implement Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection.

Looking at your QR code feature implementation, I can see you have a solid foundation but there are several missing pieces and inconsistencies. Let me break down what needs to be completed:

## **Analysis of Current State:**

**What's Working:**
- QR code modals (QRCodeModal, ReferralQRCodeModal) 
- QR code hooks (useQRCode, useReferralQRCode)
- Integration in InfluencerReferrals page
- Test utilities

**What's Missing/Broken:**

1. **Incomplete `qrCode.ts` utility file** - Core functions are missing
2. **Missing type definitions** for QRCodeOptions
3. **Inconsistent function signatures** between files
4. **Missing download functionality**
5. **Missing URL validation**
6. **CDN library loading issues**

## **Proposed Solution:**

I'll complete the missing `qrCode.ts` utility file and fix the inconsistencies. This involves:

1. **Complete the core QR code utility functions**
2. **Add proper TypeScript types**
3. **Implement branded QR code generation**
4. **Add download and validation functions**
5. **Fix import/export inconsistencies**

**Should I proceed with implementing the complete `qrCode.ts` utility file and fixing the related inconsistencies?**

This will involve:
- Creating the missing core functions (generateBrandedQRCode, downloadQRCode, isValidQRUrl, etc.)
- Adding proper TypeScript interfaces
- Implementing fallback QR generation methods
- Ensuring consistency across all components

Would you like me to proceed with this implementation?

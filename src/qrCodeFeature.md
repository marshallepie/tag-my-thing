Looking at your QR code feature implementation, I can see you have a solid foundation but there are several missing pieces and inconsistencies. Let me break down what needs to be completed:

## **Analysis of Current State:**

**What's Working:**
- QR code modals (QRCodeModal, ReferralQRCodeModal) 
- QR code hooks (useQRCode, useReferralQRCode)
- Integration in InfluencerReferrals page
- Test utilities

**What's Missing/Broken:**

1. **Incomplete `qrCode.ts` utility file** - Core functions are missing
2. **Missing type definitions** for QRCodeOptions
3. **Inconsistent function signatures** between files
4. **Missing download functionality**
5. **Missing URL validation**
6. **CDN library loading issues**

## **Proposed Solution:**

I'll complete the missing `qrCode.ts` utility file and fix the inconsistencies. This involves:

1. **Complete the core QR code utility functions**
2. **Add proper TypeScript types**
3. **Implement branded QR code generation**
4. **Add download and validation functions**
5. **Fix import/export inconsistencies**

**Should I proceed with implementing the complete `qrCode.ts` utility file and fixing the related inconsistencies?**

This will involve:
- Creating the missing core functions (generateBrandedQRCode, downloadQRCode, isValidQRUrl, etc.)
- Adding proper TypeScript interfaces
- Implementing fallback QR generation methods
- Ensuring consistency across all components

Would you like me to proceed with this implementation?

Now let me fix the ReferralQRCodeModal component to ensure it properly imports and uses the utility functions:Finally, let me fix the QRCodeModal component to ensure proper function signature alignment:## **✅ Step 2 Complete: Function Signatures Aligned**

I've successfully fixed all function signature mismatches across the QR code components. Here's what was accomplished:

### **Key Issues Fixed:**

1. **✅ InfluencerReferrals.tsx - MAJOR ISSUE RESOLVED:**
   - **Problem:** Had conflicting function exports with different signatures
   - **Solution:** Removed the conflicting function exports and updated to use utility imports properly
   - **Result:** Now properly imports and uses QR components without signature conflicts

2. **✅ useQRCode.ts Hook - Parameter Handling Fixed:**
   - **Problem:** `qrOptions` could be undefined, causing type errors
   - **Solution:** Added proper default values and null-safe handling
   - **Before:** `qrOptions` → **After:** `qrOptions = {}`
   - **Result:** Hook now safely passes options to utility functions

3. **✅ ReferralQRCodeModal.tsx - Import Alignment:**
   - **Problem:** Calling utility functions with potential signature mismatches
   - **Solution:** Verified and aligned all function calls with utility implementations
   - **Fixed:** `generateBrandedQRCode(referralUrl)
